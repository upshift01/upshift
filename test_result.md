All 7 test cases passed: (1) Test user login successful, (2) Tier-3 checkout creation working with correct payment_id/checkout_id/redirect_url, (3) Payment record storage verified via diagnostic endpoint, (4) Payment verification endpoint responding correctly with 'failed' status for unpaid checkout, (5) Emergency activation for tier-3 successful, (6) User tier-3 access verified after activation, (7) All tiers (1,2,3) pricing comparison working correctly. The production bug investigation shows the payment flow is functioning properly - issue may be in Yoco webhook handling or specific reseller configurations."
